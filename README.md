### **Overview**

** **

This is the first Milestone Project for the **Full Stack Web Development Diploma** from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).

This website is a real-life client project for Clive Pearson of Rapier Marketing Services.  Clive is a marketing consultant specialising in SMEs and micro businesses.

This website has been built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules of Code Institute's FullStack Web Development course.

[The live version of the website can be found here](https://kat632.github.io/MS1-Rapier-Marketing/).

### **UX**

** **

**1. Strategy**

To ensure the UX is simple and user-friendly, by providing easy navigation through all pages on the site.

### **User stories**

**Visitor Goals**

*	As a website visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the website and learn more about the organisation.

*	As a website visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content.

*	As a website visitor, I want to be able to view the website clearly on any mobile device.

*	As a website visitor, I want to know what services are provided by the organisation.

*	As a website visitor, I would like to see examples of previous projects undertaken by the organisation.

**Client Goals**

*	To have a more visually pleasing website than the current version [https://rapiergroup.co.uk/](https://rapiergroup.co.uk/).

*	To minimise the risk of information overload, by condensing the text into a more readable layout.

* 	The website must represent the client and their business in a professional manner.  No visual gimmicks or massive menus.


**2. Scope**

*	To create a fluid and responsive layout for ease of use on common devices.

*	To fine-tune and implement the skills I have learnt so far on my course.


**3. Structure**

I designed this website to create a more modern and eye-catching version of the original website.  See above for link to original website.  The original website was built by Clive Pearson using a Wordpress template.  My version of the website utilises modern internet protocols to create a more aethetically pleasing experience for the user.


**4. Skeleton**

*	Wireframes - please see below in the Design section.

*	Fixed footer for the purpose of a strong and constantly present Call To Action.

*	Home page, Planning page, Tactics page, Contact page.


**5. Surface**

Please see Design section below.

### **Design**

** **

**Colour Scheme**

Rapier Marketing Services is named after the owner's father, Ray Pearson.  Ray is a Chelsea Pensioner and so the colour scheme of the website has been chosen to relect the colours of the Chelsea Pensioner uniform.  Clive also specified that he wanted to keep the blue colour #2F5596 of his existing logo.  I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to create a pallette that I thought would work well with the professional look required by the client.

**Typography**

The website uses two fonts throughout.  The headers throughout the website are using the **Cabin** font while the main text is using the **Raleway** font.  Both fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).  The fonts were chosen for their simplicity and because I am aware that sans serif fonts are better for dyslexic readers.  My information about choosing an accessible font came from [this article at Bdadyslexia](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide).

**Imagery**

Brand is important to Rapier Marketing and I wanted to ensure consistency throughout the site.  The hero images have are all of tall buildings or skyscrapers because I wanted to convey a feeling of 'reaching for the sky' and I like the sense of corporate that skyscrapers represent.

The images in the Past Projects Gallery have been provided by the client.  I would have preferred certainly the bottom row of corporate literature and brochures to be higher resolution, but unfortunately they had to be converted from pdfs and I couldn't make them any better quality.  I used [Adobe PDF Convertor](https://www.adobe.com/uk/acrobat/online/convert-pdf.html) to convert the pdfs.

The images in the Testimonials section were taken from Linkedin with the kind permission of their owners.

**Wireframes**

**Differences to Design**

In the original design, there were two buttons on each page that were meant to link to either further down the page, or to take you to a different page.  I realised that adding these buttons was not going to enhance the navigation of the site, but rather confuse it.

I also added colour to the wireframes in order to show them to the client.  Having seen the wireframes, the client requested that his blue colour be used, that he wanted more white space and that I was not to use too much red in the scheme because he feels it can be seen negatively and convey the wrong message.

**Limitations**

Due to no JavaScript functionality, apart from the Back-To-Top button as outlined in the Features section, the contact form will not store data or send emails.
