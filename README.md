GitPod was used to write all code in this repository and pushed via Git to GitHub.

**GitHub**

*   When viewable HTML files have been pushed to GitHub, select 'Settings' the last item in the repository navbar. 
*   Under 'Github Pages' and 'Source' there should be a drop-down menu with 'None' selected by default.
*   After you press the drop-down menu and select 'master', then press save.
*   Once saved, this will shortly publish the project to GitHub Pages and the site URL will be available in the 'GitHub Pages' in 'Settings'.

**Local Download/Clone**

*   You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the 'Code' button with the download icon and selecting either 'clone or download'.
*   The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
*   The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
*   User needs to open the unzipped folder and open index.html for the homepage to populate.
