### **Overview**

** **

This website is a real-life client project for Clive Pearson of Rapier Marketing Services.  Clive is a marketing consultant specialising in SMEs and micro businesses.

This website has been built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules of Code Institute's FullStack Web Development course.

The live version of the website can be found __here__.

### **UX**

** **

**1. Strategy**
To ensure the UX is simple and user-friendly, by providing easy navigation through all pages on the site.

### **User stories**

**Visitor Goals**

* As a website visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the website and learn more about the organisation.

* As a website visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content.

* As a website visitor, I want to be able to view the website clearly on any mobile device.

* As a website visitor, I want to know what services are provided by the organisation.

* As a website visitor, I would like to see examples of previous projects undertaken by the organisation.

**Client Goals**

* To have a more visually pleasing website than the current version [https://rapiergroup.co.uk/](https://rapiergroup.co.uk/).

* To minimise the risk of information overload, by condensing the text into a more readable layout.

* The website must represent the client and their business in a professional manner.  No visual gimmicks or massive menus.

### **Design**

** **
**Colour Scheme**
Rapier Marketing Services is named after the owner's father, Ray Pearson.  Ray is a Chelsea Pensioner and so the colour scheme of the website has been chosen to relect the colours of the Chelsea Pensioner uniform.

### **Deployment**

** **

GitPod was used to write all code in this repository and pushed via Git to GitHub.

**GitHub**

*   When viewable HTML files have been pushed to GitHub, select 'Settings' the last item in the repository navbar. 
*   Under 'Github Pages' and 'Source' there should be a drop-down menu with 'None' selected by default.
*   After you press the drop-down menu and select 'master', then press save.
*   Once saved, this will shortly publish the project to GitHub Pages and the site URL will be available in the 'GitHub Pages' in 'Settings'.

**Local Download/Clone**

*   You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the 'Code' button with the download icon and selecting either 'clone or download'.
*   The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
*   The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
*   User needs to open the unzipped folder and open index.html for the homepage to populate.
